# Blog

Blog page using css, js and json files to create a simple blog forum. The user can post something on the main page just to get what is on their mind off of it before seeing what everyone else posted. Think that lovable guy walking into that famous bar and having to yell "Hi" before everyone yells his name. Once they have contributed to the discussion they are then carried over to the page displaying all of the previous comments by other users and can take part in their discussions, or respond to their posts.

## Features

I used a little AI generated art of an audience hall facing the world on a stage to signify this is just the opening act of bringing my world to the audience. The layout is simple, yet backwards because of the requirements for the bootcamp course it was designed for.

## Installation

There are no dependencies or requirements. It is a simple html, java script, and basic css build that can be downloaded via zip and installed anywhere. Replace the picture with what ever you desire and post it.

## Usage

It's easy to use, type in your user name (between 3 and 20 characters) give your post a title (between 5 and 50 characters) then sound off with a short message of up to 500 characters. Think of it as a private Twitter.

## Contributing

Submit a post, or send me an email, once I get a chance to respond I will be happy to reach out and see what we can come up with.

## License

I used the basic MIT license and would like everyone to use it if it fits their needs. All I ask is to give credit where it is due and give a tag at the bottom of any page where this is posted with a link to my bio in it. https://sciberius1.github.io/AY4-Bio/index.html
